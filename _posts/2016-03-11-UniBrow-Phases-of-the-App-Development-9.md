Finally my social media app UniBrow- isnâ€™t it a funny name, huh?- is live on app store. Thanks to launch, I am going to explain all the phases when I created the product in detail.

1. Learning iOS Dev
2. Getting hands dirty, aka Development
3. Polishing
4. Preparing app for app store
5. Provisioning Profiles and Rejections
6. Happy Ending

I will write about all the phases for 3 blog posts. This is the first part of the series.

## 1. Learning iOS Dev- or A Quest for Knowledge
I am passionate about touch screens and iOS since 2009 the first I acquired an iPod Touch. I was fascinated how responsive the UI. I remembered the time I kept spending more and more time of playing with the apps(You can guess I didnâ€™t have many at that time ðŸ˜‰) and setting of the iPod.

Afterward, life brought me the point where I am right now. I can create apps for Apple Devices.

The long story the short, I attend MS in Computer Engineering, learned fundamentals of the computing and computing devices and I thought myself iOS development.

Knowing more about the Computer Science is not necessary building apps but you can easily learn app development. I think I would spend more time than I spent actually while learning development if I wouldnâ€™t know the fundamentals of Computer Science.

Google was and is still my best friend while learning iOS development.

This is the list of the source that I find on the Internet while learning iOS App Development

## Getting hands dirty, aka Development,

- Table View Controller
- Navigation Bar Controller
- Custom Table View Cells
- Scroll View
- Delegation
- RESTful API calls
- HTTP Requests
- User Interface/User Experience
- Crash Analytics
- Core Location
- UIKit

- 3rd Party Libraries

I have decided to build a social media app. Let me clarify my choice. As far as I observed then, social media let me learn the most desirable skills needed to create an app. You can see the list above.

Generally, things may not go as planned; however, this time, it did. Honestly, I was not like a charm, but it did meaning at the end.

I made daily and weekly goals for the project. I used new Notes app on Mac to keep up with the program. You can see one of my screenshot of the notes below.

I have remembered the time when I just wanted to lock the scroll view on the Story Board, googled for two days with no success and someone from slack showed me that it is just a one simple click on the properties. Such a waste of time.

This period was the most challenging and rewarding period. From scratch, I gave a life to a project. When I saw others apps, I thought they were like magicians. When I have done my first iOS apps, I realized that it was the total of the determination, persistence and motivation. I canâ€™t imagine anything more satisfying than creating a product from scratch.
