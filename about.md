After eleven years of military experience including four years of working as a naval architecture and marine engineer, I have decided to change my career path. As a result of the passion I have developed for computer engineering during my years in the Turkish Armed Forces, I was enrolled M.S. in Computer Engineering at Bogazici University. Then, I became an iOS developer.

I hold an unconditional inspiration to become a part of an iOS team that works to solve humans' problem with applying the best practices in the software development industry.
